# DIGS-for-EVEs

Welcome to the DIGS-for-EVEs repository. This repository contains a catalog of endogenous  viral element (EVE) sequences recovered via database-integrated genome screening (DIGS).

Whole genome sequence (WGS) assemblies screened in this project were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's [genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) resource.

DIGS was performed using the DIGS tool, an open software framework available [here](https://giffordlabcvr.github.io/DIGS-tool/). 

## Contents

1. **Input Files**:
    - Probe sequences used for DIGS (polypetide FASTA)
    - Reference sequence library used for DIGS (polypetide FASTA)
    - Details of the WGS assemblies screened in this project (the assemblies themselves are not included due to their large file sizes)
    - Control files used with DIGS

2. **Output Data**: 
    - Exported tables from the screening databases
