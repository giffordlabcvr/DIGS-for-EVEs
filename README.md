Welcome to the DIGS-for-EVEs repository - collating the **viral fossil record**!

This repository contains an organised catalog of endogenous viral element (EVE) sequences recovered from published genome sequence data via **[database-integrated genome screening (DIGS)](http://giffordlabcvr.github.io/DIGS-tool/)**. DIGS is an approach for systematically screening whole genome sequence (WGS) data in silico. 

WGS assemblies screened in this project were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's [genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) resource.

DIGS was performed using the DIGS tool, an open software framework available [here](https://giffordlabcvr.github.io/DIGS-tool/). 

For more information, please see the **[User Guide](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/DIGS-for-EVEs/wiki)**.

## Data Sources

Data included in this project were obtained via in silico mining of published whole genome assemblies available via **[NCBI Genomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/genomes/)**.
